The overlay of the IA facets creates a ven diagram mirroring EMBL's mission.

## Major facet structure and categories

The components of the three major facets that reflect EMBL's internal organisation and the outside user's need.

1. Who	
   - people	
1. What
   - research
      - Cell Biology and Biophysics
      - Developmental Biology
      - Genome Biology
      - Structural and Computational Biology
      - Directors' Research
      - Tissue biology and disease modelling
      - Mouse biology
      - Bioinformatics (EBI)
   - services	
      - online services (EBI)
      - core facilities
   - training	
      - online/external
      - collaboration
   - industry transfer	
   - about
     - meta info on the mission (news, jobs, mission statement, etc.)	
1. Where					
   - Heidelberg
   - Barcelona
   - Grenoble
   - Hamburg
   - Hinxton
   - Rome
   


## Explainer demonstration 

These facets can be matrixed in a number of ways, here is a sample to help visualise the relationships.
