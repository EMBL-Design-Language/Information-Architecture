# Information-Architecture
The structure of EMBL's who, what and where.

This primarily applies to web content and navigation, but this architecture is also designed to include print and other digital materials as well (e-mail, slide decks, etc.)

## Major facets
There are three major facets that reflect EMBL's internal organisation and the outside user's need. 

1. Who: the EMBL people involved
1. Mission: the division (research, services, training, industry transfer)
    - What: the type of work being done (disease modeling, bioinformatics, structural biology, mouse biology, etc.)
1. Where: EMBL's six physical geographic sites and virtual websites

## All equal, all part of EMBL
Each and all of these three are part of EMBL's mission.

But the importance of each facet may vary depending on a user's need at a given time: a user might: 
- look to connect a person at EMBL;
- connect with bioinformatics;
- the ongoings of EMBL Rome; or
- structural biology research being performed by Jane Doe at Grenoble. 

Therefore the a websites structure must be able to facilitate multi-faceted content categorisation and user navigation. 

The mix will vary across each content item (microsite, service, homepage, brochure).

## Impact on structures 
As the user needs vary we should be able to shift the design and/or display of each, some content will be location specific: 
- a list of structural researchers;
- a visitor map of the EMBL Cambridge (EBI); or
- a bioinformatics service listing.

## Conclusions
From this we can draw conclusions:
- Extreme flexibility: Templates need to be able to accommodate a mix of any/all the major facets, or they need to specifically exclude address a facet (i.e. A research webpage template can never be used for training, services, or industry transfer)
- No website sub-page lock in: Website navigation must allow users to easily transition between areas (i.e. from Rome research to Heidelberg research)
- Plan for user needs: The user types can be mapped from the major facets of content (*important!* We need to identify our target user types and map them to the IA's major facets)
    - Map our goals: as we know our content and target users, we need to link them to trackable goals (this is easier for web, but not impossible in print)
