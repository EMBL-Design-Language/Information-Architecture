# Information-Architecture
The structure of EMBL's who, what and where.

This primairly applies to web content and navigation, but this architecture is also designed to include print and other digital materials as well (e-mail, slide decks, etc.)

## Major facets
There are four major facets that reflect EMBL's internal organisation and the outside user's need. 

1. Who: the EMBL people involved
1. What: the type of work being done (disease modelling, bioinformatics, structural biology, mouse biology, etc.)
1. Where: EMBL's six physical geographic sites and virutal websites
1. Mission: the division (research, services, training, industry transfer)

## All equal, all part of EMBL
Each and all of these four are part of EMBL's mission.

But the importance of each facet may vary depending on a user's need at a given time: a user might: 
- look to connect a person at EMBL;
- connect with bioinformatics;
- the ongoings of EMBL Rome; or
- stuructural biology research being pefromed by Jane Doe at Grenoble. 

Therefore the a websites structure must be able to faciliate multi-faceted content categorisation and user navigation. 

The mix will vary across each content item (microsite, service, homepage, brochure).

## Impact on strcutrues 
As the user needs vary we should be able to shift the design and/or display of each, some content will be location specifc: 
- a list of structural researchers;
- a vistor map of the EMBL Cambridge (EBI); or
- a bioinformatics service listing. 

## Conclusions
From this we can draw conclusions:
- Extrement flexibility: Templates need to be able to accomoadate a mix of any/all the major facets, or they need to specifically exclude address a facet (i.e. A research webpage template can never be used for training, services, or industry transfer)
- No web lock in: Website navigation must allow users to easily transition between areas (i.e. Rome and Heidelburg research)
- Plan for user needs: The user types can be mapped from the each pieces of content major facets (*important!* We need to identify our target user types and map them to the IA's major facets)
    - Map our goals: if we know our content and we are targeting users, we should be sure to make trackable goals (this is easier for web, but not impossible in print)
