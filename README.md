# Information-Architecture
##### Part of the EMBL Design Language
The structure of EMBL's who, what and where.

This primarily applies to web content and navigation, but this architecture is also designed to include print and other digital materials as well (e-mail, slide decks, etc.)

## Major facets

There are three major facets that reflect EMBL's internal organisation and the outside user's need. 

1. Who: the EMBL people involved
1. Mission: the division (research, services, training, industry transfer)
    - What: the type of work being done (disease modeling, bioinformatics, structural biology, mouse biology, etc.)
1. Where: EMBL's six physical geographic sites and virtual websites

Each and all of these three are part of [EMBL's mission](https://github.com/EMBL-Design-Language/About#purpose).

## Requirements

From the above we can draw requirements on what the IA must provide:
1. Extreme flexibility: Content templates must accommodate a mix of any/all the major facets, or they need to specifically exclude address limited facets (i.e. A research webpage template can never be used for training, services, or industry transfer)
    - No website sub-page lock in: Navigation must allow easy transition between areas (i.e. from "Rome research" to "Heidelberg research")
2. Content maps to user needs: the facets used by content can reveal target users (once we identify our target user types)
    - Goals: we cand map the content -> users -> goals. These should be trackable (this is easier with web analytics, but not impossible in print)

### 1. Extreme flexibility: Impact on structures 

The mix of facets presented will vary across each content item (microsite, service, homepage, brochure).

As user needs vary we must shift the presentation order of each facet and some content will be location specific: 
- a list of structural researchers;
- a visitor map of the EMBL Cambridge (EBI); or
- a bioinformatics service listing. 

The website structure must be able to facilitate multi-faceted content categorisation and user navigation. 

### 2. Content maps to user needs: Only as important as it is to a user

The importance of each major facet varies according to user needs at a given time; a user might: 
- look to connect a person at EMBL;
- connect with bioinformatics;
- the ongoings of EMBL Rome; or
- structural biology research being performed by Jane Doe at Grenoble.
