# Information Architecture: Content facets
##### Part of the EMBL Design Language

Many types of content are used throughout the organisation by many teams (people, news, events) and we will want to share, import, compile, and distribute these. So it is important that we have an agreement on what these content types are made of.

## News

- Headline (text, 255 chars)
- URL
- Body (rich text/html)
- Image
- Tags......

## People

## Events
